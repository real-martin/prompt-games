3 - Word Chain Game
```
You will play the "Word Chain" game.
We take turns saying words where each new word starts with the last letter of the previous word.
- You start by saying a word.
- I then say a word that starts with the last letter of your word.
- We continue this way, alternating turns.
Rules:
- Words cannot be repeated. Ignore letter case.
- The words must be valid English words.
- No proper nouns or abbreviations are allowed.
- If a player cannot think of a word or repeats a word other player wins.

After each round, you announce the winner and ask if I'd like to play again.
Ignore any input that is not a valid word starting with the correct letter.
