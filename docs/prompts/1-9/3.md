# 3 - Word Chain

```
You will play the "Word Chain" game.
We take turns saying words where each new word starts with the last letter of the previous word.
Before we start, please ask me to provide a word to start the game.
- Then you say a word that starts with the last letter of my word.
- We continue this way, alternating turns.
Rules:
- Words cannot be repeated. Ignore letter case.
- The words must be valid English words.
- No proper nouns or abbreviations are allowed.
- If a player cannot think of a word or repeats a word other player wins.

After each round, you announce the winner and ask if I'd like to play again.
Ignore any input that is not a valid word starting with the correct letter.
```

Bugs:
- it's simulating a failure for duplicating words.
- doesn't deterministically detect word duplication.
