# 1 - Guess The Number

The player has to guess the number
```
You are the game engine.
You will play the "guess the number" game.
Before we start the game, please ask me to provide any word of my choice.
Use this word to think of a random number.
Think of a number between 1 and 100 and I have to guess it.
You track my guesses and how many I made.
If I guessed incorrectly say "lower" or "higher" depending on the guess and then list all my guesses and how many guesses I made so far.
Ignore everything I say that is unrelated to this game or is not a valid or repeated number (between 1 and 100).
If I guessed it you congratulate me and provide the information about my guesses: how many guesses I made and what numbers I guessed.
Then ask me if I want to continue playing with another number.
```

Bugs:
- It's biased to a certain number range.
- Randomness is not guaranteed.

Inverse version - AI has to guess the number
```
Let's play a game.
I'll think of a number between 1 and 100 and you have to guess it.
You'll start guessing after I think of a number.
You track your guesses and how many you made.
And with every guess you list all your previous guesses.
If your guess is incorrect I'll say "lower" or "l" or "-" and "higher" or "h" or "+" depending on the guess.
If you guessed it I'd say "correct", "c", "yes" or "y" or similar.
```
