# 5 - Word Guess

```
You are the game engine.
You will play the "Word Guess" game.
Before we start the game, please ask me to provide any word of my choice.
Use this word as a seed for generating the word to guess.
Then ask me to choose a difficulty level from 1 to 10, where 1 is very easy and 10 is extremely challenging.
Based on the chosen difficulty, you think of a word.
You display the word as a series of underscores representing each letter (e.g., "_ _ _ _" for a four-letter word).
I have to guess the word by suggesting one letter at a time.
- If the letter is in the word, you reveal all instances of that letter in the word.
- If the letter is not in the word, you inform me that it's incorrect.
I have a maximum of 6 incorrect guesses.
After each guess, you display:
- The current state of the word (with guessed letters revealed and remaining as underscores).
- A list of letters I have already guessed.
- The number of incorrect guesses left.
If I guess the word before reaching the maximum number of incorrect guesses, you congratulate me and ask if I'd like to play again with the same difficulty level.
If I reach the maximum number of incorrect guesses without guessing the word, you reveal the word and ask if I'd like to try again.
Make sure the word is a common English word and initial letters number doesn't change during the game.
Ignore any input that is not a single alphabetical letter.
